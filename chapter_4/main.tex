\subsection{Project Description}

The focus point of this thesis is the development of a toolkit that would enable software engineers to create with ease web-based applications that feature real-time communication with mobile devices and leverage all the sensors and feedback elements that a modern smart-phone can deliver. In the economic context, however, it is not enough to develop a framework, it is also crucial to have a demonstration application that implements logic which uses this framework, so that it can gain public attention and obtain necessary financial investments to support its further development. The 'Snowfight' game is a wonderful way to illustrate the power of real-time peer-to-peer interaction between a desktop browser and a browser of a mobile device. It can also effectively showcase the majority of the use-cases of the framework.

\subsection{Project Time Schedule}

In order to be successful, a project needs to have an effective development methodology. Presently, \emph{Agile Software Development} gains popularity and proves to be a flexible and robust way to create software. This methodology implies an iterative and adaptive process of development and this in turn influences the time table that has to be established.

\subsubsection{Objective Determination and SWOT Analysis}

The main objective of the project can be derived from its motivation. The 'Snowfight' should illustrate at its best the features of the toolkit described in the thesis. The game should represent an isometric multiplayer arcade in which participants can throw snowballs in each other and score points. The players should control their characters via their smart-phones, specifically through a web page rendered in the browser of the phone which represents a some kind of game controller. The gameplay should feel very responsive as if the player uses a wired gamepad.

Besides showing off technical feature of the framework, the game should appeal to potential players that would use it as an entertainment asset at parties or team-building events. It should be engaging and well balanced as to provide casual, yet challenging, and maybe even addictive, gameplay. It is advisable that the controller part of the system should be supported by largest possible pool of mobile devices.
